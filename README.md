# ParamDbpEditor
Allows you to edit params that use dbps and the dbps themselves.  
The following are a list of supported games I've found using them so far:  
| Supported Games          |  
| ------------------------ |  
| Armored Core 4           |  
| Armored Core For Answer  |  
| Armored Core V           |  
| Armored Core Verdict Day |  

The dbp files needed to read these special params come with the editor.  
The dbps from different games are organized into sets per game.  
These dbp sets are dynamically loaded as the folders present in Resources.   

There are various other features added in the past that may be rewritten or depreciated.
